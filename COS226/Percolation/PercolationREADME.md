# Data-Structures-and-Algorithms

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Data Structures and Algorithms. This file explains the percolation problem and how it is modelled in my solution. I got the problem from a homework assignment during my undergrad years at Princeton. I just graduated about a month ago! It's also my first post so bear with me.
